Overview \
Business and Data Understanding\
  We are speaking to Wells of Life charity. We are proposing a model help predict the functionality of wells in Tanzania. As climate change decreases the stability of atmospheric systems, water has become increasingly important. Wells of Life is uniquely well suited to address the problem of water instability in Tanzania. Their primary locus of operation is located just to the north in Uganda.  The geographic proximity will make the deployment of resources comparitively cheap. We obtained a data set of wells in Tanzania to build a model.\

Modeling\
Evaluation\
Conclusion\
  We advise that Wells for Life addopt our model to predict where their resources will be best used in Tanzania. To start, we recomend that you address already identified targets (non functional wells) in the northern side of Tanzania. This is the closest point to your existing operations.\
